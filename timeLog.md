    Worked for about a cumulative hour and a half on the Week 3 exercise.  Not too many issues while following along with 
    the course videos.  I did wait to watch the puzzle walkthrough until I'd mostly completed the puzzle.  I did need to 
    review a bit to figure out the FileNotFound exception test but otherwise not too many issues
